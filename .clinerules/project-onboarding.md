## Brief overview
These guidelines describe the preferred method for providing project context when starting a new task or resuming work on the Erobb221-Case project.

## Project Context Provision
- Provide relevant context documentation, such as `CONTEXT.md`, to give an overview of the project, tech stack, structure, and current status.
- Provide key source code files as examples of the existing codebase structure and style (e.g., `src/components/App.tsx`, `src/components/CaseOpener.tsx`).
- This helps ensure a shared understanding before proceeding with development tasks.
